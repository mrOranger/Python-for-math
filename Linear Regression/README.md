# Linear Regression

Given a Dataset of 2-Dimensional points, or N-Dimensional points, and a line of equation: __y = m*x + q__ the __Mean Average Error__ is the quantity defined as __E(a, b)__ is the average distance between the line and the points in the Dataset.

The __Regression Line__ is the line of equation __y = ax + b__ that minimize the Mean Average Error.
